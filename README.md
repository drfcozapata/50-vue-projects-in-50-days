# 50 Vue.js Proyect in 50 Days

This project is an adaptation of the course "50 Projects in 50 Days" by Brad Traversy and Florin pop of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/).

I developed the same 50 mini-projects but using [**Vue.js**](https://vuejs.org) instead of pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as in the original course.

It didn't take me 50 days to do them. It took only XX days because some of them were really simple and I managed to do 2 or 3 per day, but I never went more than a day without finishing a new mini-project since I started.

All of them were developed with Vue.js 3, composition API and \<script setup\>. The simplest ones took only a single file (App.vue), following the structure of the Vue.js SFC.

I hope they are useful for those who are starting their journey in the wonderful world of Vue.js.
