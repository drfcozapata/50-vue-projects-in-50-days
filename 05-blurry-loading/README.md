# Blurry Loading App

Mini-project 5 of the course "50 Projects in 50 Days" by Brad Traversy and Florin pop from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) but developed with **Vue.js**, and not with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The project was developed entirely in a single SFC (App.vue) that contains all the necessary code in only 76 lines of code, adding small additional details to the styles.
